The addition of support for the wireless micro access point (uAP) has required 
us to change the format of various debug and API calls.  Since there are now two
wireless interfaces (station and uAP) it is necessary to specify which interface
you wish to affect before issuing a command.

The base debug command has been changed from "wireless" to "wifi".  A summary is
provided at the end of this document showing which new commands to use to get 
the same effect as the old commands.

The debug interface has been enhanced to allow quoted input parameters.  This 
allows you to specify ssids with spaces in the name by surrounding them with 
quotes.  (Example: wifi sta ssid "my home AP").  It also allows you to reset 
values by sending an empty string.  (Example: wifi sta wpa_passphrase "")

In general, commands can be used to both view and set wireless parameters.  To 
view the current station ssid, for example, you would type: wifi sta ssid.  To 
set it you would type: wifi sta ssid new_ssid.

Finally, the uAP supports a dhcp server, which can be accessed using a new root 
command: dhcpd.  The dhcpd command will allow you to view the current client 
list (dhcpd info) and do basic configuration of the server.


General Wireless Commands: (Access by typing: wifi <cmd> [params])

  info      : Print current values of assorted configuration info
  power     : View/set the wifi board's power setting (on or off)
  enable    : Enable the radio (won't power on unless sta/uap is also enabled)
  disable   : Disable the radio
  defaults  : Restore default settings
  region    : View/set region (US, CAN, EUR, ESP, FRA, JPN or a numeric value)
  scan      : Scan to find available SSIDs
  storedscan: View results of most recent scan
  sta       : Accesses subcommands for the wifi station
  uap       : Accesses subcommands for the micro-ap


Wireless Station Commands: (Access by typing: wifi sta <cmd> [params])

  info           : Print current values of assorted configuration info
  enable         : Enable the wifi station

  wep_auth_mode  : Set (or view) the wep auth mode (open, shared, auto)
  wep_key <index>: Set (or view) wep key (must specify key index: 0-3)
  wep_cur_key    : Set (or view) index of active wep key
  wpa_passphrase : Set (or view) the wpa passphrase
  wps            : Run wps enrollee (optionally specify pin and ssid)
  wps genpin     : Generate a new WPS pin
  wps cancel     : Cancel WPS if it is running

  disable        : Disable the wifi station
  defaults       : Restore default settings
  ssid           : Set (or view) the current SSID
  ssid_prefix    : Set (or view) the SSID prefix
  security       : Set (or view) the security mode (open, wep, wpa, wpa2)
  wep_auth_mode  : Set (or view) the wep auth mode (open, shared, auto)
  wep_key <index>: Set (or view) wep key (must specify key index: 0-3)

Comparison to old command set:

wireless info           ==>  wifi info
wireless start          ==>  wifi enable  (also "wifi sta enable" and "wifi uap enable")
wireless stop           ==>  wifi disable
wireless scan           ==>  wifi scan
wireless toDefaults     ==>  wifi defaults (also "wifi sta defaults", etc)
wireless reconnect      ==>  wifi sta disable, then wifi sta enable
wireless setAP          ==>  wifi sta ssid
wireless setMode        ==>  wifi sta comm_mode
wireless setWEPkeys     ==>  wifi sta wep_key <index> [value] (Index must be 0-3.  Leave value blank to see current value of key.)
wireless setWEPAuthMode ==>  wifi sta wep_auth_mode
wireless setPassPhrase  ==>  wifi sta wpa_passphrase
wireless wps            ==>  wifi sta wps  (also: wifi sta wps pin 12345670 ssid this_ssid_only)
